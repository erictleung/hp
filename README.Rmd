The goal of hp is to allow you to pipe a function into help.

![Demo of the h function using code shown in the examples section](man/figures/hp.gif)


## Installation

The development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/erictleung/hp) with:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
remotes::install_github("erictleung/hp")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example, eval=FALSE}
library(hp)
library(dplyr)

# Simple single function
t.test %>% h

# Simple single function with parentheses
dim() %>% h

# Function but specifying package
dplyr::across %>% h

# Function but specifying package with parentheses
dplyr::summarise() %>% h
```

The `h()` function is designed to only work interactively.
